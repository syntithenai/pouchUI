Authentication in Pouch UI

Components
- Login
- Edit profile
? recover password - send email with link for autologin OR security questions before autologin locally
? register

Typically
- every database has a security object (maybe also couch default config for require valid user)  containing group names for admin and members
- a user may register and be assigned a role that matches the members group 
OR - for an approval before use situation - registered users have no roles or special newby role
	-  perhaps a public database or seriously limited newregistrations database (filter synced)






Where users are publishing website into design documents they need to be admins (do we need to publish a website in a design doc or can we just setup redirects to normal records ??)

CouchDB Security Features
Three types of users
- admin by configuration of couchdb  can do everything
- admin by roles can do everything
- member by roles can view and edit everything except design docs and limits on security and user records


Each database has security roles stored in _security
{
    "admins": {
        "names": [
            "Bob"
        ],
        "roles": []
    },
    "members": {
        "names": [
            "Mike",
            "Alice"
        ],
        "roles": []
    }
  }


Edit access can be restricted arbitrarily by update functions
eg the following into a design doc
{
   "_id": "_design/myview",
   "validate_doc_update": "function(newDoc, oldDoc, userCtx, secObj) {
      if (newDoc.address === undefined) {
         throw({forbidden: 'Document must have an address.'});
      }"
}
