each list needs their own pouchdb connection - also child lists
no matching results
no save if unchanged
search
validation
pagination
smarter solutions for large files using server
file upload - don't put unsaved attachments in DOM. Put them in the database in a temporary record and provide links. 
	- Only images need to be loaded into DOM when they are displayed as images.
recursive list rendering/activation
MM CSV foreign keys
jquery mobile integration
authentication  - todo 
no update design docs every request - only if absent or URL flag

OTHER
cm5 model using couch backend
cm5 rest api same as couch except replication
	- can i use couchdb to drive replication against php rest api ?


cmfive questions
- pagination
- search/standards for joins 
	- portability to other solutions eg couch
	- portability GUI wizard
	- allow for flexibility 
	- partials in favor of joins


DOC
when plugin is called.
- cache global template
- cache global options

- bind all matching elements for click and inner input/select/checkbox etc for delayed keyup
- 


- all functions declared in api run in scope of init function
	- options, templates


- drawing from conf - options used by 
getdb
design docs init
filesize
auth

global - apply to all lists


pagination
- header row of buttons with attribute data-pouch-action=paginate-[first|next|previous|last]
- list reload triggers assignment of attribute data-pouch-skip-to  (function updatePagination)
- model draws from select.pouch-limit value 




HAZARDS
pouchdb uses different promises implementation so .then,.catch as compared to jq with .then,.fail
